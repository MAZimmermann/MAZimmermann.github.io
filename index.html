					<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				
					<p>I am a graduate student in my fifth and final year at Marist College, enrolled in a five-year B.S./M.S. Computer Science Program. In an effort to gain more research experience, I am also enrolled in an independent thesis project in lieu of one of my classes, researching sentence embedding and sentence quality assessment with Dr. Pablo Rivas.
					</p>

					<p>For the undergraduate portion of my education, my concentration was Software Development, and I minored in IT, Cyber Security, and Music. I also completed extra coursework and independent research projects as a member of Marist's Honors Program.
